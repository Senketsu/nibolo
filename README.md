### About nibolo
A little afternoon project while waiting for a bug fix on Nim
Since i couldn't install the Boorupy_loadr and not felt like fu*king with python.
Had to satisfy my need for more oshino images.

### Features:
------------------------
* Download images from boorus
* Download images from chans
* Who the hell knows ? Its first draft.

### Install:
------------------------
Run install.sh with 'sudo' and pass 'username' as param
e.g: 'sudo ./install.sh senketsu'
The username is needed for compiling without root privilage while installing does need it
